## DX11 Game Engine written at The Game Assembly

This is not the entire engine. But rather it is the classes and systems I wrote so that I can showcase the systems that I wrote. 

The entire engine was written with 4 other programmers under a tight deadline. So some of the code is not reflective of how I code today. I also removed the code that was written to a large part with other people, so a majority of the code that is still in this repo is written solely by me. 

The project will not in any way compile or build. 
This is merely a showcase, but please have a look if you are interested. 

Here is a list of the largest features I implemented that can be found in here:

- Global indirect illumniation with spherical harmonics
- Shadow casting mesh particles
- Shadow atlassing with dynamic and static shadows
- Triple buffered rendering
- GPU driven clustered rendering acceleration structure
- Render pipeline to multiple render views
- Instanced rendering
